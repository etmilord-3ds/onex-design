## Useage

### Exiting Repos

1. Ensure that [Sandman](https://github.com/mdsol/sandman) has been updated to version: 2.0.0-rc1
2. You will need to isolate the CSS scoping than Sandman uses so that there will be no conflicts with the 1x css by adding the 'mcc-sandman' class(Name) to the areas that will not have any 1x components.
3. Wrap the areas that will be using 1x components with the &lt;ThemeProvider /&gt; component, this will keeps 1x styling from leaking out.
4. Make sure to include the external stylesheet for themeProvider - you need to do this in only one spot in your application.

Here is an example of a simple application that uses both Sandman and 1x; you will more than likely need to fine tune and possibly duplicate some styles externally in order to get things perfect. Please reach out the the [#1x-design-system](https://mdsol.slack.com/messages/1x-design-system/) Slack channel for help.

### New Repos

Make sure to import the main css file globally (App.js(x) or index.js(x)):

<Source language="jsx" format code={`import @mdsol/onex-design/platform.css;`} />

You can then import the components that you need from @mdsol/onex-design. For layout, use the Container, Row and Cols from [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/layout/breakpoints/) - as well as any of the [Bootstrap utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/api/).

<Source
  language="jsx"
  format
  code={`import { Col, Container, Row } from 'react-bootstrap';
import { Button } from '@mdsol/onex-design';
export default () => {
  return (
    <Container>
      <Row>
        <Col>
          <Button>Click Me</Button>
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </Container>
  );
};`}
/>
