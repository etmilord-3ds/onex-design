# Offcanvas
Build hidden sidebars into your project for navigation, shopping carts, and more.

## Examples
Offcanvas includes support for a header with a close button and an optional body class for some initial padding.
We suggest that you include offcanvas headers with dismiss actions whenever possible, or provide an explicit dismiss action.

### Placement
Offcanvas supports a few different placements:
1. ```start``` places offcanvas on the left of the viewport
2. ```end``` places offcanvas on the right of the viewport
3. ```top``` places offcanvas on the top of the viewport
4. ```bottom``` places offcanvas on the bottom of the viewport

<Canvas>
    <Story id='components-offcanvas--start-placement' />
    <Story id='components-offcanvas--end-placement' />
    <Story id='components-offcanvas--top-placement' />
    <Story id='components-offcanvas--bottom-placement' />
</Canvas>

### Backdrop
Scrolling the ```<body>``` element is disabled when an offcanvas and its backdrop are visible.
Use the ```scroll``` prop to toggle ```<body>``` scrolling and the ```backdrop``` prop to toggle the backdrop.

<Canvas>
    <Story id='components-offcanvas--enable-backdrop' />
    <Story id='components-offcanvas--disable-backdrop' />
    <Story id='components-offcanvas--enable-scrolling' />
    <Story id='components-offcanvas--enable-scrolling-backdrop' />
</Canvas>

## Demo

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Demo"
           args={{
               scroll: true,
               placement: 'top',
           }}>
        {(args) => {
            const [show, setShow] = React.useState(false);
            return (
                <>
                    <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => setShow(true)}>
                        Launch
                    </Button>
                    <Offcanvas {...args} show={show} onHide={() => setShow(false)}>
                        <Offcanvas.Header closeButton>
                            <Offcanvas.Title>Offcanvas</Offcanvas.Title>
                        </Offcanvas.Header>
                        <Offcanvas.Body>
                            Some text as placeholder. In real life you can have the elements you
                            have chosen. Like, text, images, lists, etc.
                        </Offcanvas.Body>
                    </Offcanvas>
                </>
            );
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Demo" />
